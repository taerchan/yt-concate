1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,900
I've just made myself a cup of tea

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,660
and I should do some housework soon

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,680
but, it got me thinking about two words
4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,400
that many students find very difficult to use.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,480
Today, I want to talk to you about 'make' and 'do'.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,620
So why are these words so difficult to use?

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,520
The answer is that both words have very similar meanings

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,440
and, in many languages

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,880
they use just one word

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,020
like 'hacer' in Spanish

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,320
So what is the main difference?

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,780
Well with 'make' you are creating something

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,940
that didn't exist before

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,300
Whilst with 'do' you're completing a task

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,440
that already exists

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,200
Now please remember

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,040
as with all English concepts

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,640
there are always exceptions

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,420
and I will talk about those after I've explained the most important parts.

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,720
So things that we can create from scratch:

21
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,900
A coffee or tea: shall I make you one?

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,660
An offer: I'd like to make you an offer.

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,520
Can I make a suggestion?

24
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,480
Alright, but only if you make me a promise.

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,480
Also: I think I've made a mistake.

26
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,860
I'd like to make a complaint!

27
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,700
Who's making that noise?

28
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,040
I've made a really important discovery.

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,420
Most things to do with business go with make

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,520
for example: profit and loss

31
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,760
Last month I made a loss

32
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,580
but this month I want to make a profit.

33
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,540
You can also make an investment into somebody else's business.

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,980
If you're sure that your football team is going to win

35
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,860
It could be an idea to make a bet on them

36
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,060
to try and earn some extra cash

37
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,740
And also, if things go really well for you

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,420
and you earn a lot of money

39
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,920
you will have made a fortune.

40
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,900
Now let's talk about 'do'.

41
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,460
I've already told you that 'do' is when you complete a task that already exists

42
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,860
For example: every night I do my homework.

43
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,080
Next week I have to do a test.

44
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,360
In science we did experiments.

45
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,500
I hope I don't have to do any interviews soon!

46
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,800
Next summer, I think I'll do a language course.

47
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,040
Housework chores are tasks, and that's an important one to remember

48
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,720
I hate doing the shopping.

49
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't mind doing the dishes

50
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,500
but I loathe (and that means really hate)

51
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,060
doing the ironing.

52
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,720
You can also do well or badly at something

53
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,120
I did badly in an exam last summer, so now I have to do it again.

54
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,820
You can do bad or good.

55
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,720
Doing good is doing something positive

56
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,240
If you eat healthily, you do yourself good.

57
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,000
You also do your best, or do your worst.

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,480
If you run a race, you should do your best

59
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,580
to try and achieve the best possible time.

60
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,340
I've got my red pen out!

61
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,960
It's exception time and unfortunately

62
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,180
there are many exceptions to do with 'do' and 'make'.

63
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,800
I told you that most things to do with money and business

64
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,180
go with make

65
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,340
However, have you ever heard the phrase

66
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,640
'Pleasure doing business with you'?

67
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,600
Business, just the word, goes with do.

68
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,140
We do business with someone.

69
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,200
I also said that housework and chores go with do.

70
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,400
But when I get up in the morning I should make my bed.

71
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,180
I also said that make was to do with creation

72
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,800
So we create art, right?

73
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,820
Wrong! We do a drawing.

74
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,020
And finally, girls, hair and make-up.

75
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:21,100
I do my hair, and I also do my make-up.

76
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,820
Ooh! Sorry! Just doing my lipstick.

77
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,240
Um, that's it for 'make' or 'do'.

78
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,040
I really hope you learnt something

79
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,320
And I would really appreciate it if you subscribe

80
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,000
and also if you attempt the quiz that I'm showing next.

81
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,280
You can leave your answers in the comments

82
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,600
And I will try and correct them all.

83
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,320
Bye bye!

84
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,000
Some.....................
